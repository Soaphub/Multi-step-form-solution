## Overview

### The challenge

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

### What I learned

Learned about Redux toolkit

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
const addOnsNext= ()=>{
		const addplan=[];
		if(planLevel && addOns){
			addOns.forEach(add => {
				const addOnsAmt= parseInt(document.querySelector("#"+add+"ed h3").textContent.match(/\d+/));
				addplan.push(addOnsAmt);
			});
			if( addplan.length > 0){
				const toatalAddOns= addplan.reduce((pre,cur)=> pre + cur);
				dispatch(addOnsTotal(toatalAddOns));
			}
		}
        router.push("/summary");
	}
```
